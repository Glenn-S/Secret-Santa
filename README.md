Secret-Santa

Authors: Kurtis Niedling, Glenn Skelton
Date: November 5, 2018


Kick ass application that generates random pairings for a secret
Santa-like exchange. The application reads in the names from a
configuration file that has the names. If a person has a partner
the file should have that persons name in the column next to them.
If they are on their own though, then the name should be on its
own line. Names are seperated by a hyphen.

example usage:

Glenn Skelton - Gianna Read-Skelton
Kurtis Neidling - Karisa Gaul
Paw Ming Nguang
Jen Blencowe - Jesse Blencowe
